This data support the manuscript, entitled "Chromatin-enriched RNAs mark active and repressive cis-regulation: an analysis of nuclear RNA-seq." (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007119) In this manuscript, a new Tuxedo-ch pipeline is introduced for nuclear RNA-seq data analysis.  The data consists of supporting data for three cell types that are H1, K562, HEK293. We provide one data matrix (R object) and its readme file for each cell type. There is an additional R code helps check the dimension of the data matrix generated by the Tuxedo-ch pipeline in three cell types.
